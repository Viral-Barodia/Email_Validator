# Email_Validator
Created an email validator which uses the API of https://emailvalidation.io/ to validate emails and return results

Learnings from this guided project:

1. Basic brush-up of HTML and content styling using CSS.
2. Fundamentals of JavaScript, especially API calls.
3. Rudimentary usage of GitHub using the Commnad Line.

Interesting!!: Got the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors" target="_blank">CORS error</a>, and hence learned about Cross-Origin Resource sharing and HTTP resquests.
